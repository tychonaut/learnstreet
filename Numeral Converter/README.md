Welcome! Here is a Numeral Converter project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using javascript.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

Roman numerals, the numeric system of ancient Rome, uses combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet to signify values. Roman numerals, as used today, are based on seven symbols:<br>
<code>
I - 1,<br>
V - 5,<br>
X - 10,<br>
L - 50,<br>
C - 100,<br>
D - 500,<br>
M - 1000.</code>
<br>
These Roman numbers are formed by combining symbols together and adding the values. <br>For example,<br><code> MMVI is 1000 + 1000 + 5 + 1 = 2006.</code> <br>Generally, symbols are placed in order of value, starting with the largest values. When smaller values precede larger values, the smaller values are subtracted from the larger values, and the result is added to the total. <br>
As another example, <br>
<code>MCMXLIV = 1000 + (1000 − 100) + (50 − 10) + (5 − 1) = 1944.</code>
